# ny_artsy_date

This is a Python package to help making creatives plan dates and outings by providing easy access to current and upcoming art-based events and restaurants within the NYC Metro area by wrapping the [NYC ArtBeats API](https://www.nyartbeat.com/resources/doc/api) and by leveraging the [Google Maps API's](https://developers.google.com/maps) as accessed through [googlemaps package](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python) as well as [gmaps](https://pypi.org/project/gmaps/) package).

The functions within return data tables and maps as needed based on a specified search radius of a starting address. There is also a function (for those who like spontanaeity) to `choose_my_art_date`, which selects one art-based event and one restaurant nearby based on a starting point. Users can further adjust for a variety of needs, such as search radius from starting point, whether the event is free, and minimum Google Places Rating (for the restaurant). 

Note: this package is dependent on the `googlemaps` and `gmaps` packages, which acces the Google Maps API. Users should obtain a Google Maps API key to use this package to its full capacity.

$ pip install ny_artsy_date

|  3 | Event_Description  | The Jewish Museum presents The Hare with Amber Eyes, an exhibition that tells the story of the Ephrussi family—celebrated in the 2010 memoir and The New York Times bestseller of the same name by Edmund de Waal—and showcases the breadth and depth of their illustrious collection. The exhibition explores the family’s rise to prominence and splendor in the first half of the nineteenth century, followed by a focus on the prolific collector and historian of art, Charles Ephrussi, to the inter-war years, and finally World War II, when the family lost its fortune and collection to Nazi looting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|    |                    | At the exhibition’s centerpiece are the extraordinary collection of Japanese netsuke, miniature carved sculptures from the Edo Period (17th-19th centuries), originally collected by Charles Ephrussi in the late 1880s. The netsuke were hidden by a maid from German officials in her mattress during World War II and later returned to the family after the war. The collection of netsuke has since been handed down to subsequent generations, serving as a connection between the past and the present. The most recent member of the family to inherit the collection, author and ceramicist Edmund de Waal, drew from them the inspiration for his memoir The Hare with Amber Eyes, continuing the family’s storied legacy of artistic and cultural pursuits.This exhibition is supported through the Exhibitions Abroad Support Program. |
